# uw-math-notes
A collection of notes from my UW-Madison math classes, written in LaTeX. The directories store all content from a specific UW-Class, jump in to see my notes and HW

## Notes
The notes directory of any class either holds only the summary notes I take before the midterm or occasionally regular notes from a class period.

## Homework
This contains the homework assignments I do weekly. Keep in mind, that my solutions very well may be incorrect or incomplete, I will not update them based on what is correct. However, I will have a separate markdown file in each directory informing you of what score I got, which should give you hints as to which areas were incorrect.
